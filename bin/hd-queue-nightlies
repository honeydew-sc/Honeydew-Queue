=over

=item execute

Use C<--execute> to actually put the items in the list. Otherwise,
we'll collect everything, output it to STDOUT, and quit, and nothing
will be queued.

     hd-queue-nightlies --execute

=item all

Use C<--all> to queue up every feature of every set, without checking
the database or the existing queues for what has already been
run/queued.
